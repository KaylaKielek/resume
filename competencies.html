            <h2 class="section-heading">Assessment <strong>For</strong> Learning</h2>

            <p>Assessment for learning is a continuous process in which the student and I both have access to their learning. During my field placements and practicums, I used assessment strategies such as anecdotal notes, exit slips, and informal student/teacher interviews to assess for learning. These strategies gave me insight into the understanding of my students in regard to the outcomes being taught and helped me to guild their learning as well as my future lessons.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Assessment <strong>As</strong> Learning</h2>

            <p>Assessment as learning is also a continuous process in which students assess themselves in order to improve their own learning. During my practicums, I used assessment strategies such as Think/Pair/Share, self-assessments, and self-reflection journals to assess as learning. These strategies gave me insight into how students view their own learning as well as how they can communicate their learning to their peers.</p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Assessment <strong>Of</strong> Learning</h2>

            <p>Assessment of learning is used to show what the students have learned during a lesson or a unit. During my practicums, I used assessment strategies such as rubrics and student portfolios to show my assessment of student learning. I created folders for each student in which a variety of their work was shown along with other assessment for and as learning. These portfolios helped me to see the big picture of each student’s understanding and properly assess their learning.</p>

            <h2 class="display-3"><strong>Classroom Environment</strong></h2>
            </center>
            <p>After seeing many classrooms set up in various ways during my field placements and practicums, I have come to realize that the classroom needs to be set up in order to fit the needs of your unique classroom. My field placements in year one and two both set up their classrooms in a ‘grouped desk’ fashion that encouraged collaboration, while my year three practicum classroom was set up in paired desks, facing the front of the room. I believe that it is ideal to have students set up in the classroom so that they can collaborate throughout the day, but sometimes you will come across a classroom that can’t focus in a group setting (like in my third year practicum) and adjustments will need to be made to suit the students in the class.</p>
            
            <p>Classroom set up and desk orientation is crucial to a successful and creative classroom, but it is also important to focus on creating a safe, encouraging, and respectful classroom environment. I believe that this can be accomplished through classroom management, having meaningful relationship with students, and having a zero-tolerance for bullying. Showcasing student work on classroom walls can also go a long way in creating an encouraging classroom full of students who have pride in their learning.</p>

            </center>
            <p>Giving students choice, variation, and different resources can really help facilitate a student’s learning in the classroom. During my practicums, I had many opportunities to facilitate student learning. In my third year practicum, I created a shape-walk activity for my grade two classroom during a math lesson. This activity provided students with the opportunity to choose how they wanted to record their information (writing or drawing) as they gathered it. This activity also helped students make connections from what they were learning in the classroom to the world around them, which helped them reach higher-level thinking in regard to shapes and the environment.</p>

            <h2 class="display-3"><strong>Planning For Learning</strong></h2>
            </center>

            <p>From the start my degree at Mount Royal University, opportunities for lesson planning were always available. I learnt lots over the past four years about backwards design and differentiation as well as learned how to integrate various subjects into a lesson. In my third year practicum, I created a unit that introduced some of history's most famous artists, such as Vincent Van Gogh and Pablo Picasso. This was my first unit that I ever planned and was exceedingly proud of it. I made sure to differentiate my lessons to suit my diverse range of students as well as integrated a bit of history. The students were actively engaged in their learning and ended the unit with beautiful works of art that they created.</p>

            <h2 class="display-3"><strong>Professional Responsibilities</strong></h2>
            </center>
            <p>During my degree at Mount Royal University, I have many responsibilities that focused on my teaching skills. In my fourth year of my degree, I was head of the Education Grad Committee which helped me with my leadership and teamwork skills. I was also part of the MRU Curriculum Review Community in my second year of my degree, which helped give me insight into the curriculum at the university as well as the process of changing curriculum.</p>
            <p>While I was a student teacher, I also had many responsibilities. I taught 75% of lessons in my year three practicum for five weeks and specifically taught Math, Science, Art, and Health. I also participated in school clubs and extracurriculars at my placement schools. With this professional responsibility came another to ensure that the students felt comfortable and safe with me. This was the most important responsibility that I had. I wanted my students to be able to have fun in the classroom as well as feel comfortable enough to learn with me and I feel that I succeeded in accomplishing that goal.</p>
