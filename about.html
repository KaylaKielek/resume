          <p>My name is Kayla Kielek and I have recently graduated from the Bachelor of Education program at Mount Royal University, minoring in Humanities. I am employed as a Children's entertainer (ie. face painting, balloon twisting...) and find that it is such an enriching experience to have fun at work while making kids smile. </p>
          <p>I am passionate about teaching because I feel that it is one of the few careers left in which you can make a big difference in someone's life. I believe that teachers need to have strong relationships with their students in order to effectively communicate and build a safe learning community in the classroom.</p>
          <p>As a teacher, I want to be able to help students reach their dreams, no matter how big they may be and give them the resources they need to succeed.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Children</h2>
          <p>I've always enjoyed spending time with children and trying to connect with them on their level. Since I've worked as a face painter for so long, I have had lots of experience working with kids. I've also had the opportunity to be a camp counselor at kids and youth church camps.</p>
          <p>I like to think of myself as a kid at heart because I still enjoy shows like My Little Pony and Disney movies. I have an easy time connecting with kids because of our common interests which I feel will be very beneficial when I begin to teach!

          <h2 class="section-heading">Travel</h2>
          <p>I've been very fortunate to be able to travel lots since I was a child. My family would always go to Disneyland or Disney World every year, it's almost our home away from home. I have also been fortunate enough to see the Mayan ruins in Mexico and as well as visit various parts of the Caribbean. 
          </p>

          <p>I recently traveled to many places in Europe over the summer which has really given me insight into teaching visual arts in the classroom. Being able to see master pieces like the Mona Lisa or Vincent Van Gogh's self portrait in person has given me new inspiration in regards to teaching as well as allows me to share these experiences with the students I teach. Because of travelling, I can take my passions and inspirations that I have gained through my journeys and instill them into the students I teach.

          <p>I have always loved art growing up. Since I was seven I've followed in my mother's footsteps and learned face painting and balloon twisting. I have always had a talent for creating something beautiful out of nothing and have had amazing opportunities to showcase my love of art, including being able to paint an outdoor mural on a community center in Calgary. I mainly like paint but I love trying to create art in all different kinds of mediums. I aspire to be a teacher who focuses on arts integration.
